# Online Retail Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project of an online retail dataset. The dataset comprises transactional data from an online retail store, spanning from 2010 to 2011. It includes essential information about customer purchases, such as product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.

The primary goal of this project is to gain insights from the data, identify sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. By conducting EDA, I aim to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and improve overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## Key Findings

- **Top-Selling Products**: The analysis reveals that party and festive supplies, including party bunting, hanging heart t-lights, and party bags, are the top-selling products.

- **Top-Selling Countries**: The United Kingdom leads in terms of sales, followed by Germany, France, EIRE, and Spain. These countries represent the highest sales figures.

- **Seasonal Trends**: November emerges as the busiest month for sales, likely due to the holiday season. This trend offers opportunities for targeted promotions.

- **Day of the Week Analysis**: Thursday is the busiest day of the week for sales, suggesting potential for day-specific promotions.

- **Outliers**: The dataset contains a significant number of outliers, which, when removed, impact the ranking of top-selling products and countries.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following strategies:

1. **Product Focus**: Consider emphasizing party and festive supplies, especially during the holiday season, to boost sales.

2. **Market Targeting**: Focus marketing efforts on countries with high incomes, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

3. **Seasonal Strategies**: Leverage the knowledge of seasonal trends to plan special promotions and marketing campaigns.

4. **Day-Specific Promotions**: Explore day-specific promotions, especially on Thursdays, to capture more sales.

5. **Outlier Management**: Carefully assess the impact of outliers on your analysis. Removing outliers can lead to different insights.
