Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id - 10,000
ii. Hours = business_id - 1,562
iii. Category = business_id - 2,643
iv. Attribute = business_id - 1,115
v. Review = id - 10,000
vi. Checkin = business_id - 493
vii. Photo = id - 10,000
viii. Tip = user_id = 537
ix. User = id - 10,000
x. Friend = user_id - 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id - 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: yes

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? YES
+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| city    | category | time_range  | star_rating | num_businesses |
+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
| Toronto | Food     | 8:00-22:00  | 2-3 stars   |              7 |
| Toronto | Food     | 11:00-21:00 | 4-5 stars   |              6 |
| Toronto | Food     | 16:00-2:00  | 4-5 stars   |              7 |
+---------+----------+-------------+-------------+----------------+  
ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? YES
+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+
| city    | category | time_range  | total_reviews | star_rating | num_businesses |
+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+
| Toronto | Food     | 8:00-22:00  |            70 | 2-3 stars   |              7 |
| Toronto | Food     | 11:00-21:00 |            90 | 4-5 stars   |              6 |
| Toronto | Food     | 16:00-2:00  |           182 | 4-5 stars   |              7 |
+---------+----------+-------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+ 
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The final query examines Toronto's "Food" businesses, comparing address, time range, star rating, total reviews, and the number of businesses, 
showing that businesses at 1669 Bloor Street W with a "16:00-2:00" time range tend to have higher ratings (4-5 stars) and more reviews than those at 2280 Dundas Street W with an "8:00-22:00" time range, 
suggesting that evening and late-night operations may positively impact ratings and review counts.

+---------+----------+----------------------+------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+
| city    | category | address              | time_range | total_reviews | star_rating | num_businesses |
+---------+----------+----------------------+------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+
| Toronto | Food     | 2280 Dundas Street W | 8:00-22:00 |            70 | 2-3 stars   |              7 |
| Toronto | Food     | 1669 Bloor Street W  | 16:00-2:00 |           272 | 4-5 stars   |             13 |
+---------+----------+----------------------+------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT city,
category,
address,
hours,
SUBSTR(hours, 1, INSTR(hours, '|') - 1) AS day,
SUBSTR(hours, INSTR(hours, '|') + 1) AS time_range,
SUM(review_count) AS total_reviews, 
CASE WHEN stars >= 4 THEN '4-5 stars'
     WHEN stars >= 2 THEN '2-3 stars'
     ELSE 'low rating'
     END AS star_rating,
COUNT(*) AS num_businesses
FROM business b
INNER JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
INNER JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE (city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Food') 
GROUP BY star_rating
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Open businesses have a higher average star rating than closed businesses.
 +---------+----------------+-----------+
| is_open | num_businesses | avg_stars |
+---------+----------------+-----------+
|       1 |           8480 |      3.68 |
|       0 |           1520 |      3.52 |
+---------+----------------+-----------+        
         
ii. Difference 2:
Open businesses have a higher number of reviews than closed businesses.
+---------+----------------+-----------+---------------+
| is_open | num_businesses | avg_stars | total_reviews |
+---------+----------------+-----------+---------------+
|       1 |           8480 |      3.68 |        269300 |
|       0 |           1520 |      3.52 |         35261 |
+---------+----------------+-----------+---------------+         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT is_open, 
COUNT(*) AS num_businesses,
ROUND(AVG(stars), 2) AS avg_stars,
SUM(review_count) AS total_reviews
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY num_businesses DESC;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I have chosen to conduct a sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews by parsing out keywords and business attributes to understand the sentiment and common themes in customer reviews.       
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
For this analysis, I will need the following data:

The "business" table to obtain information about businesses, including their categories, names, and unique identifiers.
The "review" table to access customer reviews, which include the text content, star ratings, and links to the respective businesses.
I chose this data because it provides a rich source of customer feedback and business information. By analyzing the text content and star ratings of reviews, I can gain insights into customer sentiment, identify key themes, and understand how these factors relate to businesses' overall performance.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-----------------------------------+-------------+---------------+---------------+-----------+
