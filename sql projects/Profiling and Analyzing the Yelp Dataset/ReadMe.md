## Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables.
   
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table.

3. Identify columns with null values in the Users table.

4. Explore star ratings and reviews for businesses.

5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order.

6. Find the distribution of star ratings for businesses in specific cities.

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews.

8. Investigate the correlation between posing more reviews and having more fans.

9. Analyze the occurrences of "love" and "hate" in reviews.

10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans.

## Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Analyze businesses based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. Compare differences in star ratings and review counts.

2. Conduct sentiment analysis by parsing keywords and business attributes from reviews.

3. Prepare and display the dataset for sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my SQL data analysis skills, including data profiling, inference drawing, and sentiment analysis. It provides valuable insights into customer sentiment and business performance based on the Yelp dataset.
